# Seamless Integration Demo - Presentation Script

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"Imagine you're working on a campaign report and need to share it with your team in Notion. Instead of stopping your workflow to hunt for integrations, set up connections, or ask IT for permissions - you simply say 'send this to Notion' and it just works. That's the future of enterprise integrations."*
